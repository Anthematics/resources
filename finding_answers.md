# Finding Answers

## How To Google

90% of your time as a junior developer will be spent troubleshooting. Being able to get answers quickly from Google should be thought of as a core part of a developer's job.

Here are a couple things that have helped the Bitmaker Labs team along the way. First, it's all about using key query words. More than likely, you won't get it right on your first guess, so keep trying different things until you do. If you are looking for something well explained, as well as a good example, you should Google "[resource name] [concept]".

For example, if I were looking to learn more about Array#each in Ruby I would Google "ruby monk array each" or "api dock array each". As soon as I found a result that looked promising, click it and use **"cmd + f"** to search for a particular word. For example, type "each" into that page search.

### Google Tips

A couple things to remember when googling:

1. Use 3 or 4 specific keywords or phrases (use resource names as keywords, i.e. "api dock ruby each", "ruby each")
2. Try a couple of different combinations
3. Look at the first 10 to 20 results each time

### Resource Quality Hierarchy

You'll get better at knowing which resources are the best with time, but usually follow this order in quality:

1. API Documentation
2. Tutorials
3. Stack Overflow
4. Blog Articles

### Stack Overflow Tips

You'll find the majority of the bugs in your code will have already occurred in someone else's code and if you're lucky, they will have posted their problem to Stack Overflow. When going through Stack Overflow, try to look to see if the problem they are having is quite similar to yours. As soon as you believe it is, go to the answer looking for a) a good example b) a good explanation. Some general guidelines to decide the quality of the post and answer are as follows:

1. Amount of votes and answers
2. Look at the recency of the article
3. Credibility of person who posted

### Bookmarking Resources Tips

As you go through the program, you will find that the number and variety of resources you go through is massive. Try to develop a methodology to organize them early on. The process we use is as follows:

1. Create a folder called "Programming" or "Bitmaker Labs"
2. Create folders in the "Programming", organized by topic. For example, "Ruby" or "JavaScript"

## Exercises
1. Create a Stack Overflow account
2. Create a folder for bookmarking resources
3. Optional - Create a Quora account to build your reputation
